# Player-observed defect docket

Defects seen while playing the live build, in the owner's words, with the
port-side finding underneath. Nothing counts as fixed until a worklog says so and
a focused smoke proves it.

Opened 2026-08-10 from a play session on the shipped web build.

## Fixed

### D1: firing the hyper crashes -- FIXED in W226

Reported as a crash; it was the port's honest `Unreached` on a longword at
`$24BAF6`, the second frame of a hyper beam. The arithmetic was right and the ROM
window was short: the twenty `$24BB0A` pairs point at `$28`-byte strips that
`$2550A0` walks DOWN, so they span `$24B7EA..$24BB0A` while `$24A800+$1100` stops
at `$24B900`. The shared hyper strip `$24BAE2`, the ship arm's upper powers and
the whole formation arm were outside every window. Normal play survived only
because TYPE-A with formation 2 takes the `+$0` arm. Fix: one window,
`$24B900+$02AA`, which also carries the pair table seam-free.

### D2: hyper pickups move far too fast -- FIXED in W226

`$27F0E8 movem.w ($1a,A6),D0-D1` reads two words, at `$1A` and `$1C`. The port
read one word at `$1B`, straddling the pair, so the row `$FFF4001F` moved the
short axis by `$F400` (-3072) instead of `$001F` (+31). Same body: the two draw
biases were swapped, and the animation advance ran after the draws instead of
before, with the borrow inverted.

### D7 (partly) and the rank icons -- FIXED in W230

The rank-icon tables `$2882A6` (P1) and `$288326` (P2), eight longwords each, had
never been harvested into the sprite bundle, so the port enqueued a rank icon
every frame and the page had nothing to draw. Found by the new descriptor sweep.

### D9: CLOSED in W231 -- a death, a respawn and the pods all work

W227 translated `$24CA60` (it clears fifty words of the option block), W228
translated `$25FFA8` (the respawn/game-over fork) and W231 translated the player
object's one-time INIT `$2491C0`/`$249246`, the SET/bonus panel `$2603B0` behind
it, and the pods' deploy `$24C934` it makes reachable.

A death now runs its animation and reset, spends a life, creates a fresh player
object, puts the ship back at the position the respawn entry carries, gives it
`$F0` frames of invulnerability, and deploys its pods to exactly the target
`$24C928` names. The headless scenario survives three deaths and two full
respawns.

What remains is not a defect but the next frontier: when the LAST life goes, the
game-over arm arms dispatcher request 2, which is `$260056`, the credit/continue
entry. That creates object types `$D` and `$B`, and type `$B` is the same
unported `$25DBB4` that D11 is about, so the two meet there.

## Open, in priority order

### D11: the stage transition is abrupt -- DIAGNOSED, first piece landed in W232

The owner's words: finishing a level, the ground goes, then the ship disappears,
then it reappears in the new level, far too abrupt -- the real game runs a big
transition sequence there.

W232 forced `$242952` headlessly and measured it. The stage machine WORKS: the
type-6 object runs, the clearing flag sets, the stage word steps, the player parks
and the object retires. What is missing is the presentation, and all of it was
already counted by address:

- the banner's zooming ENTRY picture `$23F82A` -- **PORTED in W232**, and its five
  per-stage pictures are in the sprite bundle now (they never were, so the banner
  could not have drawn even with the emitter),
- the TX TEXT printers `$240DC2` and `$240EBC`, 60 calls per transition, a
  subsystem no wave has touched,
- the banner's five `$24150A` resource installs plus the slide-out's,
- the RESULT SCREEN: `$23C638` palette cue, `$246410` animation-object load,
  `$28D77C` sixteen longwords of palette RAM, `$28DE72`/`$28C186` exit handshake,
- `$253794`, the option-pod teardown.

So this is three presentation tiers on a working machine, not one missing engine.
The text layer is next and pays for itself three times: D6's score popup and D7's
gauges are likely waiting on the same printers.

Correction to the earlier lead: `[11]` `$25DBB4` is NOT the transition. Its state 0
picks a per-player table, arms a `$4B0` timer, and its body watches `$23C932` and
`$803808` -- it is the credit/start/continue controller, which is why `$260056`
creates it. `[4]` `$260B30` is still unported and still runs twice a frame.

### D3 and D4: missing explosions in stages 1 and 2, and the stage-2 mid boss

The descriptor sweep settles what these are NOT. Over 900 frames of stage-1 play,
after the rank-icon fix, **every descriptor the port draws is in the bundle** and
the display list drops nothing. So a missing explosion is not a missing stream
and not a dropped record: its PRODUCER is not running.

The counted gaps from the same run name the candidates, and the effect ones are
`$289AF4` (the secondary effect spawn, "D0=$4 secondary", W26) and `$27F8F8`
(the bullet death effect). Next step for D3 is to run the sweep and read the
counted-gap list rather than to guess: the instrument is
`tools/w230descriptorsweep.mjs`.

### D5: the systemic sprite question -- INSTRUMENT DELIVERED in W230

`tools/w230descriptorsweep.mjs` answers "which sprites cannot draw" mechanically:
it takes the display list the port actually builds and checks every descriptor
against the bundle's own stream table. Bundle-wide it now reports zero. Re-run it
per stage and per boss as coverage grows; a missing sprite that is not in its
output is a producer problem, not a bundle problem.

### D6: bees give no score popup and no collect feedback

Check whether the collect credits score at all or only the presentation is
missing. `src/bee.js` into `src/score.js` / `src/hud.js`.

### D7: the hyper gauges are not painted

The gauge word does count (`$81B642` steps down by 2 per frame while hyper is up,
verified headlessly in W226), so this is likely presentation. The rank icons under
"Fixed" were one instance of the same family; the gauge needs its own look.

### D8: the ship may be missing its large exhausts

Only tiny exhausts draw. Since the sweep says nothing the port draws is missing
from the bundle, the exhaust is either a draw the port never makes or a part of
the ship record it never fills. Check `src/shipsprite.js` against the ROM.

### D10: mobile landscape wastes most of the screen on the browser bar

Presentation only, no simulation risk. The page shell in `src/web/` wants a
fullscreen request on first input plus `viewport-fit=cover` and `100dvh`.

### D12: the repo documentation is well behind the code

`docs/` still describes the project as it was several waves ago:
`00-MASTER-REFERENCE.md`, `01-PORT-PLAN.md` and the `recon-*` documents predate
stages 3 and 4 entirely, and nothing in `docs/` except this docket and
`NEXT_AGENT_HANDOFF.md` mentions the Stage-4 boss, the hyper, the death chain or
the web bundle's shard layout. Worth one pass that brings the top-level documents
up to the code, states where the port actually is stage by stage, and points at
the worklogs for detail rather than restating them.
